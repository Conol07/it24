                    <h1>Who is GKC</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Gene Kenneth Conol, 22 years old, from Sto. Niño, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon. I am passionate about cars, sports, and continuous learning. 
                        I am currently studying at Northern Bukidnon College, where I am honing my skills and knowledge to prepare for a successful career.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                
                        My father, Daryl Gene Conol, and my mother, Madjin Q. Conol, have been my pillars of support. They have always encouraged me to pursue my interests and strive for excellence in all aspects of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a non-pro drag racer, I find joy and excitement in the thrill of speed and precision. I am also a skilled mechanic, able to troubleshoot and repair vehicles, which complements my love for racing. 
                        Apart from racing and mechanics, I am an avid basketball player. The sport has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am balancing my academic pursuits with my passions. I believe that with determination and hard work, I can achieve my goals. My motto is simple: <strong>"Continue grinding to have a good life."</strong> 
                        This mantra drives me to keep pushing forward, no matter the obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am excited about the future and the opportunities it holds. I am committed to making the most of my skills and experiences to build a fulfilling and successful life.
                    </p>
